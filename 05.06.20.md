## City Explorer Walk-thru
* heroku open will open your local site if you lost your URL link 

## 2nd session
* copy data folder and get that into the project
* we will want 2 end points, location and weather 
    * .get /location console.log  hello: location
    * .get /weather console.log hello: weather 
    * validate in postman (command n, click request, or just open a new tab with plus sign)
    * this is where debugging happens 

- query parameters is how you get info from front to back end 
- req.query refers to ? in the URL
- req.params refers to backslashes inn the URL

* paste in location object into res.json
* paste in weather object into res.json
* validation steps for endpoints:
    * check that i can log something aka hello world to the console
    * check that i can res.json and get something in postman
    * check that i can log out the right thing in the console
    * check that i can res.jso the right thing and get it in postman 

* const locationData up top
* console log locationData
* res.json locationData
* const mungedData where console log locationData was 

* make a utils file 
* make mungelocation function 
* back in index, import mungedlocation the require way
* export mungedlocation
    * module.exports = 

* experiment qunit test in example.test.js
    * there should be a md file
    * in tests.js, require utils - change tests.js to utils.tests
    * in utils, module.exports
    * 1 test that gets fed data
    * 2 test that gets null
    * package.json, change scripts to include test or test watch
    * npm run test:watch to have updating tests 




* return { 
    formatted... to display name
    latitutde to lat
    longitude to lon
* test should be failing successfully

* change qunit test
* require the data into the top of qunit
* make sure expected and results match 
* run 'should return an empty object' test
    * results = null
* try - catch in utils for mungelocation 

* same for weather, as location
* mungeWeather in res.json
* and import at the top of the index.js
* and add your weather data 
* back in utils, function mungeweather, which return forecast time keys
* then utils.test and import mungeWeather
* copy sequence of tests done for location and change to weather aka mungeWeather
* expected: forecast and time
* don't forget to export mungeweather
* in utils, transformedData
* try - catch transformed data 
* return transformedData.slice(0, 8) shows you forecast for those 8 days 

* server.js city prac in dani's github shows example code for yelp api

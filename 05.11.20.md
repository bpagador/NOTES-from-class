## SQL Joins

* a general structuring to requesting joins:
    * select
    * from
    * join
    * on
    * where, can be smushed at the end (then make change in server js if your backend, it would look like: req.params.id)
    --
    * insert into
    * values 
* using delete is super easy:
    * delete from 
    * where id= or name ilike=
        * ilike is case insensitive 

* using update syntax in sql 
    * update
    * set name =
        * you can update multiple things
        * set name=, cool_factor=
    * where name =
    * returning *
    --
* checking off todos
    * theres a true, a boolean, involved
    * and reg.query -- or something
    * research this

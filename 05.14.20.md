## General 
### Software Developmeny Cycle

* define the problem: users have no place online to keep track of what they need to do it and what they've already done

* designing and planning: how would i know if this problem is solved?
    * we need a way for users to creaye, view,and complete todos, and to keep their todos separate from other users 

* defining and the outcome and defining validation 

* when breaking down tasks, try to think in vertical slices (working software)
    * ### for example:
    * Vertical Slice:
        * list todos
            - use hard coded todos from .json file
                - validation: console.log the todos file in react code and see it in the browser
            - render simple todos on the page
                - i can see simple todos renderd in the browser
            ======LATER==================
            - use hard coded seed todos from SQL and express
                - we can log out data from the endpoint to react
                - we can see the endpoint data rendered in react components
        * create todos
            - we need to add a form on the list page with a txt input and a submit button
                - make sure my event handlers work on the inout and the button by logging out to the console onClick and change
                    - first log out hello world 
                    - the log out the actual values of the user input
            - once i know my event handlers work, i want to put the new todo into my state on click
                - first lets do it a fake, front end todo
                ======LATER==================
                - then lets hits out create todo route and make the ACTUAL todo to put on the page 

        * create users
        * only show a single user's todos
        * complete todos
            - when the user clicks on the todo, it should change to done (strikethru)
                - make sure the event listeners work by logging out 1. hello world and then 2. to do on click
                - change state so that this todo list is complete (all front end)
                    - console.log state in render to validate that this happened
                - in render, if a todo is completed, style it differently
                ======LATER==================

## In an app:
get
    import or fetch data, import some functions, grab some html elements 
initialize
    some state data
    set some event listeners 
set 
    setting the state in response to user inpput 
    set the DOM (html elements) in response to state change

*DON'T BE AFRAID TO ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS, REMINDER THAT YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR LEARNING ALL THIS STUFF 

## On the developer tool console today:

textContent is for everything but inputs
getElementById  = getting elements in the DOM 
document.querySelectorAll('span)
const spans = document.querySelectorAll('span)
spans.forEach(span =>){
    span.style.color = 'pink'
}
divs.forEach(div) => {
    div.style.background = 'black'
    dic.style.color  = 'white'
}

*ASK about reading values with text input

commit messages should follow the "this commit will..." logic 

## lab 01 on  03.31.20

the stateful situation is how many cups of coffee you're drinking per day 
the upper limit is 5 cups 

make your repo

npm init

live serve

it works, in body 
    (in css, html margin: 0, padding:0, height: 100%)

<div class=container> 
    (in css display" flex, flex direction: column, justify-content: center, align-items: center, background-color: pink, height: 100%)
add title, water the plants between <h2>


plant status: <span id=status>thirsty

current ounces <span ... >

img id=plant, can adjust height and width in the css 
    (# targets id in html in the css) 

button, id-"water-button" , add water 

In app.js

get by Id (document.getElementById)
    const button
    const img
    const status
    const ouncesSpan

let ounces = 0; //initialized state

button.addEventListener ('click', () => (
    ounces++;

    ouncesSpan.textContent = ounces;

    if (ounces > 10){
        status.textContent = 'oh no...';
        img.src = "link to sad plant"
    }

    if (ounces > 20) {
        status.textContent = 'it is drowned';
        img.src = "link to sadder plant"
    }
))

$ debug steps
    1. open up the console 

webkit-linear-gradient
    for CSS, creates a linear gradient 

temp1.value will cast a string in the console
    if it gives you trouble, wrap around number ()

math.random 
    randomizes number 
    math.ceil rounds off to the nearest whole number 
    math.ceil(math.random)

input type=number 
function compareNumbers(guess, correct){
    //if the guess and correct number are identical, return 0, if the guess is lower, return -1, if the guess is higher return 1

}

import compareNumbers from 

## guess number lab 
app.js

import addSeven.js
const expected
const actual

assert.equal (expected, actual)

^^ test

const should be let 
there are two event listeners, one for resetting and one for reading the amount of submits 

IF EVERYTHING GOES WELL, WHERE CAN I BE IN 5 YEARS
WHAT VALUE ARE WE ADDING AS A COMPANY?

## General 
* in real life, all data has an ID
* .toggle might be something you use to hide 
* we can change values of properties as long as we don't reassign the whole array in which the properties are held
* when in doubt of what is called what - hover over the element  
* outerHTML gives you the string rendition of the element
    * like stringify in JSON
* testable functions need return

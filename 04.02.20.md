## General 

* code in global scope runs on load 
* declaration: how we create a function
* scope: dictates the order of the way the code is run 
    * global is the parent 
    * local is the child 
* functions need to eat and the parenthesis is the mouth 
* WET code = write everything twice code
    * hard to read
    * hard to use 
* DRY = don't repeat yourself
    * reusable
    * lessens possibilities for error 
    * only have to make changes in one place 
    * makes code modular (lego blocks)
* parameters is declaring - menu
* argument is calling - the actual dish

## Lab info:

* merge dev to master on the repo your partner will be working on 
* basically go to your PR and merge to github
* p.s. merge your code whenever the TA has graded it 
* then fork it 
* then cd to the local branch
* then code. 

## Tasks
* ask Dani or a TA to walk me through my GitHub for lab-04-r-p-s and go over naming conventions

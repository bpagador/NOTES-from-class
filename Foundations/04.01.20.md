### Journal 3 insights:

* make it a point to review lab from the day before, before the start of class

* improve the systems I am using to take notes, make it a point to learn the how-to to make utility more effective

### Lab: Rock, Paper, Scissors 

* state:   
    * user choice (r, p, s)
    * how many games you've played
    * how many games you've won 
    * how many games you've lost 
    * computer throws
* view:
    * when the user clicks a different choice button 
    * set to zero on the start button 
    * increment on the lets play button 
    * on let's play click: if your throw beats the computer throw
    * on let's play click: if your throw loses to the computer
    * change on let's play button

* state and view have a bidirectional relationship, state touches view and view touches state

* Application logic:
    * decide how to pick a winner in a given throw
    * use state to calculate draws and win percentage
    * figure out a random throw for the computer 
    * how to reset the game (so we have to figure out what resetting means)

### Lab exampple: Coin Flip

* in index html:
    * comment driven development
    * heads and tails
        * div id=>
        * label> Heads <img src = > <input name="coin" type="radio" value="tails">
        * label> Tails <input name="coin" type="radio" value= "heads">
    * play button - submit
        * button id=>
    * score section
        * div id=>
        * span id= wins>
        * span id= lossses>
    * reset button 
        * button id=>

* in app.js:
    * const playButton = doc...
    * const scoreSection = doc...
    * const radios = document.querySelectorAll('input')
    * const headsInput = radios [0]
    * const tailsInout = radios [1]
    * playButton.addEventListener ('click', () => {
        console.log(tails is checked, headsInput.checked)
    })
    * let userChoice = ''
        * if userChoice = 'heads'
        * else userChoice = 'tails'
    * let computerChoice = ''
        * if (Math.random() <5>)
            * computerChoice = 'tails'
        * else same as above but for heads

* in stylesheet:
    * look at screenshot

* didWeWin.js
    * export function 


### General 

* named and default exports:
    * named exports necessitate the correct name, default don't 
    * if you're doing a named export, make sure to "export function namedFunction" preceded by the function 
    * you must put curly brackets around named functions 

* Scope
    * decides where we have ACCESS to a given variable (inside or outside a variable)
    * p.s. node nameoffile.js logs to the console

* querySelector eats things that are valid CSS
* radio buttons have values 
    * buttons also need eventlisteners
    * you have to tell the eventlistener how to respond

* when testing function:
    * change example.test.js name 
    * change name on tests.js
    * call function you're testing 
    * import {functionName} from '../functionName.js'
    * add variable 
    * set variables equal to true or false 
    * live serve example test
    * make sure it's not a false positive and break it 
    * remember import default doesn't need a specific name 
    * TDD = test driven development 

* in body
    * background-image: url ('link')
    * background-size: auto

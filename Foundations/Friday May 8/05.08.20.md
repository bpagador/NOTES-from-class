* '/songs/:id'
* req.params.id
* which changes the select 

* once the endpoint is working 
    - note: https in the componentdidmount 
    * change route on listpage (GroceryList)
    * in detailpage, this.props.match.params.id
    * import request superagent
    * componentdidmount, async, use your localhost since you havent deployed yet, put the this.props.match.params.id in there 
    * put that state = { song: } up top
    *  then setState fetchedData.body[0] under component did mount 
        - you can avoid that subzero if you change data.row in server.js
    * then import your listitem into the render section of grocerylist page 

* listpage.js 
    * key
    * link - doesnt look good unless you wrap it around the div

-- pre-lunch lecture, lab set up etc--
- we will be adding a resource page 
* inserting into a table is like 
    * see screenshot in folder
    * now we have to write our first app.post (whenever post happens to a plural, thats a create)
    * insert disco chicken insert data in to app.post 
    * in postman, choose POST to add to the list 
    * change key value pairs in postmans
    * then go to the endpoint and add req.array
    * connections drawn out in a screenshot dani uploaded to the repo 
* error handling : try/catch
    * res.json(e)

-- post lunch 
* admin page 
* form:
    * inputs s
    * user_id will be automatically be set to one, and will no be included in the inputs 
    * all the name= 's 
    * for key with number, type="number"
    * for is cheap in your case you'll need radio and value
        * and a is NOT cheap input 
    - css for form will matter in this case 
    * handle submit up top
    * AND set the state of isCheap to false 
    * then go back to your labels and this.state.form them 
        * checked= the two boolean labels
    * each input also needs onChange handlers aka this.handleWhateverChange
        * both boolean inputs can have the same onChange values
    * now you gotta make the handleWhateverChanges= (e) => 's 

* to test:
    * in api calls.test.js
    * look at the function dani wrote 
    * so that and npm test in terminal

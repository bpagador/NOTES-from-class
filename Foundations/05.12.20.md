## General
* testing on postman
    * body and tests are lit green 
    * chai is where the our expects come from 
* JSON.stringify() to stringify 

* Authentication 
    * are you who you say you are?
* Authorization
    * we know who you are, but are you allowed to do the thing?
    * the wristband is the token

* the database/backend stores your password as a key (of random characters, called a HASH) and the node server compares that key to the password you entered 

* token flow screenshot is in lab 12 
* sign in and sign up routes are represented 

## Lab Flow

* create users. js
* heroku create 
* npm run setup-heroku
* take db put it into the .env
* npm run setup db
- if your npx script is not working (aka the new routes), you might need to define the routes in app.js
- you can check if your scripts are running in server.js
- basically defining your routes is about getting your app.get endpoints in app.js instead of server.js
* create auth and ensure auth is where the auth flows are doing the works for us 
* in server.js
    * import ensureAuth and createAuthRoutes
    * get rid of the display_name stuff 
    * put authRoutes in app.use('/auth)
    * considering ensureAuth and the path given to it, all endpoints must have /auth/ in front of it now 
- don't forget to npm i bcrypt and all that

* go to postman
* check on the server
* check on the route (/auth/animals)
* add email and password key to the body (green dot, JSON, raw)
* put key and value in strings because JSON
    - to use urlencoded in postman, change app.use.express.urlencoded (sp) in server.js of your backend
    - NOW you can use the key value inputs in post
* a token will come back 
* if you decode the token on JWT.io (jot io), you'll see each email/pw combo has an id 

* in order to use your token to check out /api/animals :
* Headers in postman
* GET
* key = Authorization
* value = your token
* no you're able to see your api!

* on app.get/api/animals:
* req.userId so that you can get the animals for that user 
* you would also need to add WHERE owner_id=$1 into that endpoint

* to create animals for porky
* app.post/api/animals (same route as above because thats RESTFUL)
* SQL a table into the endpoint
* the way to write it is a bit complicated, refer to dani's code 

* then, in postman:
* add name and cool factor key value pairs 
* again, via body and urlencoded radio button 

 * if we want to keep track of animal vaccination :
 * booleans in table, all the tables 
 * is vaccinated, should use a default 
 * then run setup db
 * after running setup, you'll have to go thru the rigamaroll of signing up again 
 * so go ahead and re-add animals to a user after getting a token 

 * then it looks like app.post changes to app.put
 * followed by a change to the table structure and the syntax for put uses UPDATE SET and WHERE (AND creates a user constraint)
 - the owener_id should be equal to the req.userid, so that other users can't touch patient zero user's animals
 * to vaccinate, choose PUT in postman and then type in the id of the animal in the URL, you want to vaccinate
 * with the todos lab, it will be a complete or not complete boolean instead of vaccinate/not vaccinate 

## Lab Instructions

* make a todo app
* make a sign up page
* make a sign in page
* don't foget about changing the app secret in the .env file 
* to write tests, lookup postman tests,a dnwrite simple tests you'll probs need screenshots of

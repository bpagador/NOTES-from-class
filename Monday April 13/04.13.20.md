## Today's stuff
* classes (enemy, goblin, firegoblin)
* this.name (HP, HP++, etc)
* constructor ()
* super ()
* complex state management
* .slice and .splice

## General
* refer class construction on the repl Dani is sending
    * https://repl.it/@dpcairns/classes
* know we will use classes in react, but we are not going to build our classes 
* other languages use classes more than we will through the program 
* reactjs.org
* functional programming is the 2020 way, we are in a moment of transition 
* slice returns a copy of a portion of the array 
* splice has three properties (index to start, how many you want to remove, what you want to replace it with )
* !== means not equal to
* for and forEach loops are pretty similar, but while loops will apply to different sitatutions 
* anything that is an application logic needs a function
* || means otherwise / OR
* nameing two elements the same thing via name= makes them mutually exclusive (either or)
* css-tricks for css tricks 
* a css tag (the value before { key: value}) must match the order in which what you're trying to call is stacked on html 

## Lab Related 
1. Data Files:
    - JS file containing our products
    - DATA ARRAY (products) needs key value pairs
        - id, image, names
        - the data will be sent to local storage 
    - exported to...

2. HTML & JS FILES
3. 

    - one HTML file for survey portion
    - JS file is grabbing 3 random images from data array and allow the user to select one of them
        - the amount of time an image is displayed has a counter that increases 
            - math.random function communicates with whatever function we write to read radio buttons * 
        - pull from local storage
        - push information to local storage which is responding to our radio buttons 
        - radio buttons 
        - this will run 25 times TOTAL
        - every time a button is clicked/submitted, the play count decreases
            if play count is ZERO redirect to results page

    - second HTML file is where results appear
    - JS file contains a function 
        - pull from local storage 
        - push all time results to local storage *
        - the function prints out a list of the name of the item and how often it's chosen 

4. Individual user sessesion should restart
    - Next button / Reset button

5. Non-duplicating images automatically display
    - refer to the way Dani wrote this code for two images 
    - comparison of two functions, each of which contained ids that were being compared as well

6. Results page: how many time products were viewed + votes received
    - the function prints out a list of the name of the item and how often it's chosen 
    - the amount of time an image is displayed has a counter that increases 
                - math.random function communicates with whatever function we write to read radio buttons * 

7. Create a separate page for the following:
    - second HTML file is where results appear
    - JS file contains a function 
        - pull from local storage 
        - push all time results to local storage *
        - the function prints out a list of the name of the item and how often it's chosen 

## List of functions: 
 - getItembyId 
    - getRandomByID


## Questions, go-back-to topics
* what is Math.floor again?
* JSON parse-ing in one line versus two lines, look at your wine lab
* truthy falsy
* for loop and forEach funcs
* vscode settings and tricks 
* event.target, what does it do ?
    * I think it targets something in the event

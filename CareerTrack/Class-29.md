## Topics covered:
- layered architecture
- separation of concerns 
    - easier to write, maintain, test, and reuse 

## General Notes:
- models manage data, will handle calling backend APIs 
- views present data, presentational and functional components
- controllers take user interaction and decide how to handle interaction
    - all class based components will be controllers 
- MVP
    - model: api
    - presenter: container
    - view: presentational

- when you invoke a method within an event we have a target, we expect the state to be one thing anf the toequal to be the thing it should be equal to

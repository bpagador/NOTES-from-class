## Topics covered:
* full stack build out together 

## General Notes
* ?. = looks for a condition, if its truthy, then invoke it -- otherwise don't
* !! flips truthyness to falsiness
* .lean takes function from a mongoose object to a plain old javascript object (POJO if you will - Jacob)
* async and await come in super handy when needing to create content to be able to run a test with it 

## Lab related:
* npm i -D supertest
* npm i express mongoose cors
* npm i mongodb-memory-server

## Question, Go-Back-To:
* go back to your list test in the execute function
    * remove toJSON and reintroduce .map
* WHAT IS JSON.whatever and WHAT DOES IT DO?


## Progress, Realizations, AHA Moments:
* making a little change to the text to see if I can push up to github

## General 

* git stash =  stashes your code 
* git commit  =  commits all your changes 
* forking = github thing, not a git thing
    * make a copy of a repo of another persons repo in your github repositories tab 
    * let's us make changes to code without affecting the canonical codebase 
    * do open source collaboration
* cloning = just puts a copy of the repo on your computer; you have to fo extra work to get it into cloning
    * aka it had nowhere to go 
* funny how the conversation about open source started with "the criticism is that open source is not great for marginalized voices" and suddenly a bunch of non-marginalized (white dudes) voices started asking about how to get credit for contributing to open source and applauding unpaid labor
* branching = enables us to do code review instead of forcing our code into final product 
* git.wtf = good website for checking out how to do things 
* git pull origin master is where most of your conflicts will come up

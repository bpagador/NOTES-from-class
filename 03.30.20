## GitHub

Master Branch
    source of truth 
    single source of truth
    perfect, final deployed code
    triggers testing and deployment
    branches are borne from a master branch

Dev Branches -- also called Feature branches
    PR = pull request 
    once you feel really good about your code, "pulling" is asking someone to look at it and approve it 
    you can then collaborate on the dev branch inside github
    approvals and rejections can happen here, also edits and comments

General
    git push origin master should not be used as pro devs on the job 
    git pull origin master is good because it is pulling that perfect deployed code 
    code review in imperative to be able to git push origin master 
    INSTEAD, git push origin "whatever you branch is"
    there are multiple branches that also have branches, popular ones are "staging" and "dev" -- they're all diff environments
    someone who's really good to talk about this with: Noah

alert, prompt, confirm
    return breaks a function  
state / view:
    ex. state is whether the user has taken the quiz, 
        view is change quiz result text
        user interaction is the user clickig the button to launch the quiz
        try to keep all of the state at the top
isYes reads the yesses but you have to feed it conditional statement 
if you want to import from js file to js file, you have to use export default and import
